      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In
        a free society, transparency is government's obligation to share
        information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold their
        public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government
        should be transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials
        conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money must be readily
        available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and just
        governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides
        information for citizens about what their Government is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also believe that government should be participatory. Public
        engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves the
        quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and
        public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge.
        We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in American
        government.
      </p>
      <p>
        TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily
        find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify information of
        greatest use to the public.
      </p>

      <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
      <p>
        In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny
        and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the
        Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist
        doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project.
        The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can also be
        traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included
        Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation
        as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
        approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related
        to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.
      </p>

      <p>
        Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776)
        and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and
        requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in
        constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by
        Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously
        opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham,
        Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
        democratic practice and is often linked to the passing of freedom of
        information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted
        the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its
        modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the
        presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its
        Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
        legislation in 1999).
      </p>

      <p>
        The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966,
        FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed
        in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
